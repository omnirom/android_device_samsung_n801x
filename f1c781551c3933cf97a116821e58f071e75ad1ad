      "message": "Just making sure, by leaving the build.prop values as GT-N8013 we allow users to move back to n8013 ROMs, right? Though actually, the sound config depends on one of these values, so we would need to change TARGET_DEVICE GT-N801x I think? But then, wouldn\u0027t the asserts fail if users tried to install an n8013 ROM?",
